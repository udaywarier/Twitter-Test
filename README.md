# Twitter-Test 

This contains a simple Twitter bot that picks a tweet from a random stream and tweets out the string that results from reversing each word in the tweet while keeping spaces intact. It is meant to serve as an introduction to the Twitter API and a building block to develop more complicated bots in the future.

To run the bot, navigate to the src directory and simply run "node test.js", or run "npm start" to invoke the npm script from the root directory.
